### WINS!!
The Project was done out of love.  We all were all very interested on getting our Portfolios showcased to everyone and also get "partnered" with other experienced Web Developers to join projects to keep our newly acquired skills fresh.  Big Wins: We were able to get MVP on "our" Targeted time.  We worked as an awesome team!  Big kudos!!!!

### CHALLENGES of the Project
Some challenges were around the scope of the project.  The routing was easy because we used a MEAN boilerplate, but it was difficult to remember where things were routed in the project.  We attempted to use 2 models, but we found challenges storing user data.  Another challenge was accessing our current user from the database and how to use AUTH to give user access to pages as well as protecting current users profiles for public views.  And our biggest challenges / success was trying to figure out how we could implement our tinder-like swipe feature using angular.  We went with slider effect, but styling and adding routes to our customized card-panels and doing what we to wanted was very time-consumming.

### If we had another week....
We would do much more styling to the site.  We also would implement our stretch goal which was putting a chat feature from the contact page using socket.io.
