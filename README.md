### WINS!!
The Project was done out of love.  We all were very interested on getting our Portfolios showcased to everyone and also get "partnered" with other experienced Web Developers to join projects to keep our newly acquired skills fresh.  Big Wins: We were able to get MVP on "our" Targeted time.  We worked as an awesome team!  Big kudos!!!!

### CHALLENGES of the Project
Some challenges were around the scope of the project.  The routing was easy because we used a MEAN boilerplate, but it was difficult to remember where things were routed in the project.  We attempted to use 2 models, but we found challenges storing user data.  Another challenge was accessing our current user from the database and how to use AUTH to give user access to pages as well as protecting current users profiles for public views.  And our biggest challenge: was trying to figure out how we could implement our tinder-like swipe feature using angular and also our cloudinary API was throwing a tantrum and not able to render our images most of the time.  We were still perplexed on how to use the "many" different codes regarding carousels that would work with Angularjs.  Styling and adding routes to our customized card-panels were somewhat difficult and doing what we to wanted so that it would fit the "customized" carousel templates was very time-consumming.

### If we had another week....
We would reassess our API cause our site had difficulites getting images to show on a timely manner.  We would "love" to continue styling the site.  We also would implement our stretch goal which was putting a chat feature from the contact page using socket.io.
